# pez_comms (ROS Noetic)

This folder contains the ROS Noetic version of the `pez_comms` package. It mirrors the behaviour of the ROS 2 Humble implementation found under [`pez_ros/pez_humble`](../../../pez_ros/pez_humble/pez_ws/src/pez_comms/README.md). The node is configured entirely through YAML and handles acoustic modem I/O, triggers, schedules and services just like its Humble counterpart.

Use it on BlueOS when running a Noetic workspace to interface with the Tritech MicronModem.
